## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to get your local copy up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Heshbon/social-media-dashboard

   cd social-media-dashboard/backend

  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
  
  PORT=your_port_number

4. **Run the server:**
  ```bash
  npx nodemon

## Usage üöÄ

1. Access the API: The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

- Register/Login: Use the appropriate endpoints for user authentication.
    
- Explore API Endpoints:

  - POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
  
  - POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate an existing user.
  
  - GET /api/users: Retrieve all users.
  
  - POST /api/posts: Create a new post.
  
  - GET /api/posts: Retrieve all posts.
  
  - PUT /api/posts/:id: Update a post.
  
  - DELETE /api/posts/:id: Delete a post.

## Authentication üîë

The backend features a secure user authentication process using JSON Web Tokens (JWT):

  1. **User Input:** Users provide their email and password for login.
  
  2. **Validation:** The server checks if the credentials are valid.
  
  3. **Token Generation:** On successful authentication, a JWT is generated and returned.
  
  4. **Authorization:** The token must be included in the headers for protected routes.

This approach ensures secure access to the API while allowing users to maintain their sessions seamlessly.
